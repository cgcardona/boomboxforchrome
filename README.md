Boombox.js has been greatly received by the web development community. One of
the limitations of boombox.js is that you must visit the site where the boombox
is embedded in order to hear the audiofile. We asked ourselves 'What if you
could take your boombox with you across the web?' With that in mind we are
releasing Boombox for Chrome™.

Boombox for Chrome™ by Audiofile is a new extension for the Chrome browser. It
leverages the amazing functionality of HTML5 along with the extensive API
provided by Chrome to give you the ability to bookmark boomboxes and to listen
to them no matter where you are on the web.

Free Download available in the [Chrome Web App Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bpfbenefadjgimlnjjldiemofhgehjch).
